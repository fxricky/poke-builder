## Poke Builder

This is an exercise during the React refreshing course. <br>
It is built using React 16.<br>

This poke builder able to:
* connect to firebase cloud firestore to retreive ingredients and add to your 'BOWL'
* signup and login (even you sign up using invalid email still will do) :D
* save your preference and let others know what is your build

Libraries involved: <br>
1. firebase cloud firestore
2. axios
3. react-router-dom
4. @material-ui/core
6. react
5. react-redux
7. redux-thunk

This refreshing course uses latest update from React Hooks.<br>
All the components in this web app are functional component instead of class component ( which I learnt during the first time I used React)<br>
